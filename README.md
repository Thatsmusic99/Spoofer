# Spoofer
Spoofer is a fake player generator which doesn't just use packets - it genuinely fools the server into thinking a given player is real. This allows for it a server developer or admin to test commands and plugins with fake players to see how the server would respond with real players. 

AKA, the worst thing to happen to Minecraft plugin development.
